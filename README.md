I'm a postdoctoral researcher in the [Bruna Lab](https://github.com/BrunaLab) at University of Florida. I'm a chemical ecologist / quantitative ecologist currently looking for faculty positions on the West Coast (of the US).

- 🔭 I’m currently working on an integral projection model (IPM) for a tropical understory plant
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the [`ipmr` package](https://github.com/levisc8/ipmr)
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on chemical ecology projects in need of data analysis and visualization
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with best practices for simulating climate data for ecological forecasting
- 🫖 I'm also a huge tea geek!
